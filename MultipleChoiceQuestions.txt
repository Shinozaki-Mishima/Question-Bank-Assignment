Suppose cursor refers to a node in a linked list (using the IntNode class with instance variables called data and link). What statement changes cursor so that it refers to the next node?
A. cursor++;
B. cursor = link;
C. cursor += link;
D. cursor = cursor.link;
A

Suppose cursor refers to a node in a linked list (using the Node class with instance variables called data and link). What boolean expression will be true when cursor refers to the tail node of the list?
A. (cursor == null)
B. (cursor.link == null)
C. (cursor.data == null)
D. (cursor.data == 0.0)
B

Which boolean expression indicates whether the numbers stored in two nodes (p and q) are the same. Assume that neither p nor q is null.
A. p == q
B. p.data == q.data

C

Suppose that p is a reference variable that contains the null reference. What happens at runtime if the program tries to activate a method of p?
A. IllegalArgumentException
B. IllegalStateException
C. NullPointerException
D. The results are unpredictable.
D

Suppose that a method has one node as a parameter and it returns two references to nodes. What's the best header for the method?
A. IntNode foo(IntNode p)
B. IntNode, IntNode foo(IntNode p)
C. IntNode[ ] foo(IntNode p)
D. void foo(IntNode p, IntNode answer1, IntNode answer2)
C

In the linked list version of the Bag class an instance variable manyNodes is used to keep track of how long the linked list is. Why not just make a call to the IntNode method listLength()?
A. The listLength() method is O(n) and the alternative is O(1).
B. The listLength() method is private.
C. The listLength() method results in an infinite loop for circular lists.
D. The listLength() method works only for lists of integers.
B

For the linked-list version of the Sequence ADT, which operations are constant time operations in the worst case?

B. addBefore is constant time, but not addAfter
C. Both addAfter and addBefore are constant time
D. Neither addAfter nor addBefore are constant time
D

What kind of list is best to answer questions such as "What is the item at position n?"
A. Lists implemented with an array.
B. Doubly-linked lists.
C. Singly-linked lists.
D. Doubly-linked or singly-linked lists are equally best
C

C

Which of the following applications may use a stack?
A. A parentheses balancing program.
B. Keeping track of local variables at run time.
C. Syntax analyzer for a compiler.
D. All of the above.
C

Suppose we have an array implementation of the stack class, with ten items in the stack stored at data[0] through data[9]. The CAPACITY is 42. Where does the push method place the new entry in the array?
A. data[0]

C. data[9]
D. data[10]
C

In the array version of the Stack class, which operations require linear time for their worst-case behavior?

C

In the linked list implementation of the queue class, where does the insert method place the new entry on the linked list?
A. At the head
B. At the tail
C. After all other entries that are greater than the new entry.
D. After all other entries that are smaller than the new entry.
C

In the linked-list version of the Queue class rather than the Stack class, which operations require linear time for their worst-case behavior?
A. getFront
B. insert
C. isEmpty
D. None of these operations require linear time.
D
